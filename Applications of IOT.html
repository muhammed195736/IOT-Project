<h1>The Applications Of IOT</h1>
<ul style="font-size:140%">
 <p> <li><b>Create new efficiencies in manufacturing </b>through machine monitoring and product-quality monitoring. Machines can be continuously 
 monitored and analyzed to make sure they are performing within required tolerances. Products can also be monitored in real time to identify and address quality defects.</li>
  </P> <p> <li><b>Improve the tracking </b>and “ring-fencing” of physical assets. Tracking enables businesses to quickly determine asset location. 
  Ring-fencing allows them to make sure that high-value assets are protected from theft and removal.</li>
  </p> <p><li><b>Use wearables to monitor human </b>health analytics and environmental conditions. IoT wearables enable people to better understand
  their own health and allow physicians to remotely monitor patients. This technology also enables companies to track the health and safety of their employees, which is especially useful for workers employed in hazardous conditions</li>
</p> <p> <li><b>Enable business process changes</b>. An example of this is the use of IoT devices to monitor the health of remote machines and trigger
 service calls for preventive maintenance. The ability to remotely monitor machines is also enabling new product-as-a-service business models, where 
 customers no longer need to buy a product but instead pay for its usage.</li>
</p> <p><li> <b>Drive efficiencies and new possibilities</b> in existing processes. One example of this is the use of IoT to increase efficiency and
 safety in fleet management. Companies can use IoT fleet monitoring to direct trucks, in real time, to improve efficiency.</li>
</p>
<p><li><b> Smart home
</b>  IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, which can include lighting, heating and air conditioning, media and security systems. Long-term benefits could include energy savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off.

A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and appliances.For instance, using Apple's HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and accessories controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch. </li></p>
<p><li><b> agriculture</b> There are numerous IoT applications in farming[67] such as collecting data on temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, pest infestation, and soil content. This data can be used to automate farming techniques, take informed decisions to improve quality and quantity, minimize risk and waste, and reduce effort required to manage crops. For example, farmers can now monitor soil temperature and moisture from afar, and even apply IoT-acquired data to precision fertilization programs.[68]
<p><li><b> Military applications
</b>The Internet of Military Things (IoMT) is the application of IoT technologies in the military domain for the purposes of reconnaissance, surveillance, and other combat-related objectives. It is heavily influenced by the future prospects of warfare in an urban environment and involves the use of sensors, munitions, vehicles, robots, human-wearable biometrics, and other smart technology that is relevant on the battlefield.[94]
