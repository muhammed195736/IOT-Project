<h2>What is Internet Of Things?</h2>
<p style="font-size:140%">In the broadest sense, the term IoT encompasses everything connected to the internet, but it is increasingly being used to define
 objects that "talk" to each other. "Simply, the Internet of Things is made up of devices – from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables – connected
 together," Matthew Evans, the IoT programme head at techUK, says:By combining these connected devices with automated systems, it is possible to "gather 
 information, analyse it and create an action" to help someone with a particular task, or learn from a process. In reality, this ranges from smart mirrors
 to beacons in shops and beyond.
</p>
<p style="font-size:140%;">"It's about networks, it's about devices, and it's about data," Caroline Gorski, the head of IoT at Digital Catapult explains:
 IoT allows devices on closed private internet connections to communicate with others and "the Internet of Things brings those networks together. It gives
 the opportunity for devices to communicate not only within close silos but across different networking types and creates a much more connected world."

<h2> What Is Industrial IoT?</h2>  
<p style="font-size: 149%">Industrial IoT (IIoT) refers to the application of IoT technology in industrial settings, especially with respect to instrumentation and control of sensors and devices that engage cloud technologies. Recently, industries have used machine-to-machine communication (M2M) to achieve wireless automation and control. But with the emergence of cloud and allied technologies (such as analytics and machine learning), industries can achieve a new automation layer and with it create new revenue and business models. IIoT is sometimes called the fourth wave of the industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0. The following are some common uses for IIoT:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 149%">
<p><li> Smart manufacturing
</li></p>
<p><li> Preventive and predictive maintenance
</li></p>
<p><li>Smart power grids
 </li></p>
<p><li>Smart cities
 </li></p>
<p><li>Connected and smart logistics
 </li></p>
 <p><li>Smart digital supply chains

 </li></p>
</ul>
