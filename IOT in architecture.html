</center><h1> IOT in Architecture</h1>
<p style="font-size:140%">IoT systems are often conceived as a layered modular architecture of digital technology.[10] The device layer refers to the physical components: CPS, sensors or machines. The network layer consists of physical network buses, cloud computing and communication protocols that aggregate and transport the data to the service layer, which consists of applications that manipulate and combine data into information that can be displayed on the driver dashboard. The top-most stratum of the stack is the content layer or the user interface</p>
<table style="font-size:140%" border= "1">

<li>Edge IT</li>
<li>Data center and cloud.</li>

<table style="font-size:140%" border= "1">
<tr> 
<th>Stage.1</th>
<td><img src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sensor-230x300.png"  width="150" height= " 150"></img></td>
<td>The outstanding feature about sensors is their ability to convert the information obtained in the outer world into data for analysis.For actuators,these devices are able to intervene the physical reality. For example, they can switch off the light and adjust the temperature in a room.</td>

<tr>
<th>Stage.2</th>

<td>The vital importance of this stage is to process the enormous amount of information collected on the previous stage and squeeze it to the optimal size for further analysis. Besides, the necessary conversion in terms of timing and structure happens here.In short, Stage 2 makes data both digitalized and aggregated.
</td>

<td>During this moment among the stages of IoT architecture, the prepared data is transferred to the IT world. In particular, edge IT systems perform enhanced analytics and pre-processing here. For example, it refers to machine learning and visualization technologies. At the same time, some additional processing may happen here, prior to the stage of entering the data center.

<td>The main processes on the last stage of IoT architecture happen in data center or cloud. Precisely, it enables in-depth processing, along with a follow-up revision for feedback. Here, the skills of both IT and OT (operational technology) professionals are needed. In other words, the phase already includes the analytical skills of the highest rank, both in digital and human worlds. Therefore, the data from other sources may be included here to ensure an in-depth analysis.</td>
