<h1>IOT in Health care</h1>
<ol >
<li><b>Cost Reduction: </b>IoT enables patient monitoring in real time, thus significantly cutting down unnecessary visits to doctors, hospital stays and re-admissions
</li>
<li><b>Improved Treatment:</b> It enables physicians to make evidence-based informed decisions and brings absolute transparency
</li>
<li><b>Faster Disease Diagnosis:</b> Continuous patient monitoring and real time data helps in diagnosing diseases at an early stage or even before the disease develops based on symptoms
</li>
<li><b>Proactive Treatment:</b> Continuous health monitoring opens the doors for providing proactive medical treatment
</li>
<li><b>Drugs and Equipment Management:</b> Management of drugs and medical equipment is a major challenge in a healthcare industry. Through connected devices, these are managed and utilized efficiently with reduced costs
</li>
<li><b>Error Reduction:</b> Data generated through IoT devices not only help in effective decision making but also ensure smooth healthcare operations with reduced errors, waste and system costs
</li>
</oll>
<p>Healthcare IoT is not without challenges. IoT-enabled connected devices capture huge amounts of data, including sensitive information, giving rise to concerns about data security.

Implementing apt security measures is crucial. IoT explores new dimensions of patient care through real-time health monitoring and access to patients’ health data. This data is a goldmine for healthcare stakeholders to improve patient’s health and experiences while making revenue opportunities and improving healthcare operations. Being prepared to harness this digital power would prove to be the differentiator in the increasingly connected world.</p>
