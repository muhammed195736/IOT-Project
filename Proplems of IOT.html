<h2>The problems of IOT</h2>
<ol>
<li> Security</li><p> One of the greatest threats to the IoT comes from the strain put on the global system of information exchange that the IoT relies upon. The Global Risks Report of 2018 highlights the menace of cyber-attacks and the danger to all interconnected enterprises if the IoT is compromised as a result of internal weaknesses. Clouds will be the first to be compromised as security regulations are still not fully developed given how severe the issue. The Annual Economic cost of cybercrime is estimated to be around 1 trillion US dollars, which supersedes costs of natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and Katrina.</p>
<li>Privacy</li> <p>Another pressing issue with the IoT is that of user privacy. Not only is hacking a security breach, but also a violation of consumer privacy. A recent study at the University of Glasgow shows that consumers are largely unsatisfied with the lack of privacy the IoT allows them. As users have grown more aware of the extent of cyber-surveillance, they have begun taking their privacy more seriously and thus demand that the ultimate control over their data should remain with them. An increased corporate transparency is needed to ensure that user data is not vulnerable to others.

</p> 
<li>Internet Walls</li> <p>The risk of losing important data via hacks is a dangerous proposition not just for corporations, but also for nations via cross-border attacks. The World Economic Forum predicts that these attacks will propel nations to create internet walls that will limit the activity of the IoT to particular regions. Moreover, nations will eventually be motivated to protect their economic interests as governments cannot operate freely in a global system of online companies and enterprises. This ultimately compromises the very idea of the IoT as barriers prevent the unregulated exchange of data that many corporations demand. Regulations such as this will also serve as an obstacle to technological advancement by substantially slowing it down.

</p> 
<li>Cloud attacks</li> <p>Observing the traces of this digital war, it is highly likely that the next potential threats to IoT would be cloud networks. This is because cloud networks have the biggest data stocks to run the IoT. According to recent statistics, the annual economic cost of cybercrime was estimated around $1 trillion in 2017, which is a multiple of 2017â€™s record-year aggregate cost of almost $300 billion from natural disasters. To comprehend the magnitude of the problem, the World Economic Forum report quotes a study that put forward the takedown of just one cloud provider could cause $50 billion to $120 billion of financial damage.

</p> 
<li> Understanding IoT</li> <p>Rapid growth in technology has resulted in a limited understanding of the IoT. For consumers to make use of the internet and all that the IoT has to offer, it is essential to work upon their awareness of the changes taking place within IoT to make it more efficient. Not only will the comprehension empower them, it will prepare them mentally and they will possibly be able to find solutions on how to take caution from any of the mentioned problems.

</p> 
<li>Lack of Confidence</li> <p>According to the latest research report shared by the State of IoT Security, which was released at the end of October, showed the following information:


<ul>
<li>96 percent of companies and 90 percent of consumers believe there should be IoT security code of practice.

 </li>
<li>54 percent of consumers possess an average of four IoT devices, but then again only 14 percent consider that they are familiar with IoT device security.

 </li>
<li>65 percent of consumers are petrified about a hacker monitoring their IoT device, whereas around 60 percent are fretful of their personal or professional data being leaked.

 </li>
